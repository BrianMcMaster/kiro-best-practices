# Contributing to Kiro Best Practices

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project aims to provide comprehensive best practices for development teams using Kiro IDE.

## üéØ How to Contribute

### Adding New Best Practices

1. **Steering Documents** (`.kiro/steering/*.md`)
   - Create focused, actionable guidelines
   - Use clear examples and code snippets
   - Reference official documentation when possible
   - Include both "do" and "don't" examples

2. **Agent Hooks** (`.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook`)
   - Follow the established JSON format
   - Include clear, specific prompts
   - Test with real projects before submitting
   - Consider performance impact (disable by default if heavy)

### Improving Existing Practices

1. **Update steering documents** with new patterns or tools
2. **Enhance hook prompts** for better AI responses
3. **Add file patterns** for broader coverage
4. **Improve error handling** in automation

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Steering Documents

```markdown
---
title: Your Practice Name
inclusion: always  # or fileMatch, manual
fileMatchPattern: '*.ext'  # if using fileMatch
---

# Your Practice Name

## Section 1
- Clear, actionable guidelines
- Specific examples
- Tool recommendations

## Section 2
- More guidelines
- Code examples
- Best practices
```

### Agent Hooks

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "name": "Descriptive Hook Name",
  "description": "Clear description of what this hook does",
  "version": "1",
  "when": {
    "type": "fileEdited",  // or "manual"
    "patterns": ["**/*.ext"],  // or "button_text" for manual
  },
  "then": {
    "type": "askAgent",
    "prompt": "Clear, specific instructions for the AI agent..."
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Your Contributions

### Before Submitting

1. **Test steering documents** - Verify AI follows the guidelines
2. **Test hooks** - Ensure they trigger correctly and provide value
3. **Check file patterns** - Verify they match intended file types
4. **Performance test** - Ensure hooks don't slow down development

### Testing Process

1. Create a test project with relevant files
2. Copy your changes to `.kiro/` directory
3. Restart Kiro IDE
4. Test automatic hooks by saving files
5. Test manual hooks via the Agent Hooks panel
6. Verify steering documents influence AI responses
